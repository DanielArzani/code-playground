## Security Considerations

Rendering code directly into an iframe can pose security risks, especially if the code is not sanitized or comes from untrusted sources. Since your application is primarily for demonstration purposes on your blog, this might be less of a concern, but it's something to be aware of.

## Where I left off

- Style the editor

  - Change it so that it can be have tabs (_should be through the html and css files_)

- Turn it into a re-usable function in order to place multiple ones in a blog post or something of the sort

- Look up how to use the sandbox attribute on the iframe for security reasons

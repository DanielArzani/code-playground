## Security Considerations

Rendering code directly into an iframe can pose security risks, especially if the code is not sanitized or comes from untrusted sources. Since your application is primarily for demonstration purposes on your blog, this might be less of a concern, but it's something to be aware of.

## Where I left off

- Do final refactor and get the code working

  - Fix the tabs styles

  - Add a new theme for the text since the old one won't work and delete the un-needed css

- Add convenient plugins

- Look up how to use the sandbox attribute on the iframe for security reasons
